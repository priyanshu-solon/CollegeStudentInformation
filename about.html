        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the College Student Information System!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our website aims to bridge the gap between students and companies by providing a centralized platform for managing student information. For students, this system offers the opportunity to showcase their academic performance, coding profiles, and other relevant details, making it easier for companies to shortlist candidates for job opportunities.</p>
        <p>Developed as a final year project, this system is designed to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of students and recruiters. In addition to facilitating job placements, our project has the potential to grow into a comprehensive educational platform. Future advancements may include features such as providing study materials, offering online courses, and expanding into a job portal specifically tailored for freshers.</p>
        <p>We are committed to continuously improving our system to better serve the needs of both students and companies, and your feedback is always appreciated!</p>
